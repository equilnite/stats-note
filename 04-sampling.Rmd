# Sampling

When we have a question about a certain populationÂ (an entire group of
individuals). Ideally we would ask them all (take a **census**). But
contacting every member of a population often isn't very practical: it
would take too much time and cost too much money. Instead, we put the
question to a **sample**, or subset of individuals of the population
from which we actually collect data, chosen to represent the entire
population.

When you want to identify the population, ask yourself, what does the
question want to know about? What group of people does the
question/problem address?

When identifying the sample, ask yourself, what group does the work done
actually address?

## Bias

When we collect data, there is the possibility of the data becoming
systematically pushed towards a specific outcome. For example, if we
want to learn about the GPA average in the school and take a sample of
students only from a class, it's quite possible that the sample is not
representative of the school. We will probably result in a GPA average
that is higher or lower than the actual GPA average in the school. There
are several ways that this can happen. The main way that we learn are:

### Response Bias

### Non-response Bias

### Voluntary Bias
