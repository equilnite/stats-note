Unbiased Estimator A statistic used to estimate a parameter is an if the mean of its sampling distribution is equal to the true value of the parameter being estimated. Not all statistics are unbiased estimators and the data that we collect always has to follow a random process that is representative of the population. Variability of a Statistic The variability of a statistic is described by the spread of its sampling distribution. This spread is determined mainly by the size of the random sample. Larger samples give smaller spreads. The spread of the sampling distribution does not depend much on the size of the population, as long as the population is at least 10 times larger than the sample (10% Condition). 10.1 Sampling distribution of \\(\\hat p\\) Choose an SRS of size \\(n\\) from a population of size \\(N\\) with proportion \\(p\\) of successes. Let \\(\\hat p\\) be the sample proportion of success. Then: The mean of the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat p\\) is \\[\\mu_{\\hat p} = p\\] The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat p\\) is \\[\\sigma_{\\hat p} = \\frac{\\sigma_p}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\] as long as the 10% condition (\\(n \\leq (.10) N\\)) is satisfied. As \\(n\\) increases, the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat p\\) becomes approximately Normal. Before you perform calculations, check the Large Counts condition is satisfied: \\(np \\geq 10\\) and \\(n(1-p) \\geq 10\\) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
