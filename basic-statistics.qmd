# Basic Statistics

## Sample Mean

$$\bar x = \frac{1}{n}\sum x_i = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$$

## Sample Standard Deviation

$$s_x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum (x_i - \bar x)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i -\bar x)^2}{n - 1}}$$

The [*variable in the context of the problem*] typically varies by [*value of SD*] from the mean of [*value of the mean*]
