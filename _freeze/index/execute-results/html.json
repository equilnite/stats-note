Take a look at the tool bar on the top and try right clicking on math equations to see options to enlargen math equations. Ask Mr. Chang if you want to explore more.\n\nThese notes are incomplete, but I'll be trying to update them completely before the AP test. Give me any feedback that you might want to see on these notes.\n\nLook at the rest of these notes through the navigation bar on the left hand side (might have to click on the hamburger icon), or go through these sequentially by clicking the arrows on the left and right hand side.\n",
