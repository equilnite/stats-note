# Calculator applet

This is meant to be something similar to how your calculator works. The behavior is not working that well yet, but it's here if you want to use it for now. Things that this can do are calculator commands like:

- `normalcdf`

- `invNorm`

- `geometcdf`

- `geometpdf`

- `invT`

- `tcdf`

- and basic arithmetic (though instead of `^` for exponents, you have to use `**`)
