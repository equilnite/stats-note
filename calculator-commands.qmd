# Calculator Commands

## Distributions

To access these, you go to `2nd > VARS (DISTR)`.

As a reminder

* you use the `cdf` commands when you want to calculate a probability involving multiple values; for example, $P(X < 3)$ or $P(-1 < X < -3)$

* you use the `pdf` commands when you want to calculate a probability involving a singular, specifc value; for example, $P(X = 3)$ or $P(X = 0)$

* you use the `inv` commands when you want to a value/number that corresponds to a specific probability; for example, if you have the probability $P(X < x)$ and you want to find $x$.

### List of relevant commands

- `normalcdf(lower bound, upper bound [, mean, standard deviation])`

- `invNorm(area [, mean, standard deviation])`

- `tcdf(lower bound, upper bound, df)`

- `$\chi^2$cdf(lower bound, upper bound, df)`

- `binompdf(n, p [, k])`

- `binomcdf(n, p [, k])`

- `geometpdf(p ,x)`

- `geometcdf(p, x)`
