In this project, you will investigate multiple quantitative variables and construct a LSRL from the multiple variables. You will apply all Chapter 3 and 12 knowledge that you have learned and use Google Sheets to analyze your data by creating scatter plots and other visualizations to check the assumptions of linear regression inference.

## Part 1: Choosing your data 

In this project , you will each choose data to analyze from the [CORGIS Datasets Project](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/index.html)

Look at the descriptions of the dataset and look at what variables you can analyze. Before making a final decision, **make sure that your data set has at least 4 quantitative variables that you can work with.**

When you are done with that, please write your choice on the attached spreadsheet in Google Classroom. **Only 1 person per data set**

Visit <https://stapplet.com/quant2v.html> and explore some relationships between the quantitative variables that you have. You will have to download the data set. Please create a new Google Doc, paste screenshots of the <mark>3 - 4</mark> scatter plots that you create, and write down your thoughts about them.

## Part 2: Regression Lines

Now that you’ve explored multiple relationships between variables, now you can create some LSRLs for your selected variables.

::: callout-tip
Considering what you found out in Part 1 about some of the relationships, decide whether you want to keep exploring those relationships or not. You want to keep some or look at a new relationship(s).
:::

For this part, you will explore **3 of these relationships** and calculate and interpret several things about them.

For each of these 3 relationships, you will use the [same stapplet app](https://stapplet.com/quant2v.html) to

1.  calculate the LSRL,
2.  provide a screenshot of what the scatter plot looks like with the LSRL now,
3.  write the LSRL in context of the problem,
4.  interpret the intercept $a$
5.  interpret the intercept $b$
6.  use the value of $s$ and $r^2$ to talk about how well the line predicts the values
7.  use the residual plot to talk about how well the line fits the data.

::: callout-important
You’re expected to write each of these correctly as you have in chapter 3.

## Part 3: Starting Multiple Regression

You’ve explored multiple relationships, explored multiple LSRLs for them, and now you’re going to put everything into one equation!

Imagine our original goal: to just take two variables and find out about whether they have a true relationship in the form of 
$$y= a + bx + \epsilon $$. 

::: {.callout-note title="Multiple Regression Model"}

We’re now going to take this a step further and take multiple variables to see if they have a linear relationship with $y$:
$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p $$

Where, for the simplicity of notation, we’re now going to write $a$ as $\beta_0$, which is our intercept. And we now are able to use any number, $p$, of explanatory variables ($x_1$, $x_2$, $\cdots$ , $x_p$) and each one has their own “slope” ($\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, $\cdots$, $\beta_p$).

And we are going to use our same method of Least Squares Regression to estimate each of the  to achieve:
$$ \hat y = \hat \beta _0 + \hat \beta _1 x_1 + \hat \beta _2 x_2 + \cdots + \hat \beta _p x_p $$

:::

With all of your insights from the previous parts, **decide on one response variable**. Leave what you think is interesting as explanatory variables. If you’re not sure what explanatory variables might be interesting to keep, *continue reading*…

Now use this applet <https://stapplet.com/multreg.html> and calculate a multiple regression line. In this applet, you’re able to enter multiple data for explanatory variables. If you weren’t sure about which explanatory variables to have before, you enter your data first! And you decide not to go through with it, just uncheck the “Included in model” checkbox for that variable.


Answer the following questions using the output for your model:

1. What is the equation for multiple regression line?
2. Interpret each of the coefficients ($\hat \beta _0$, $\hat \beta _1$, $\cdots$, $\hat \beta _p$) that the output has provided to you. In other words, interpret the intercept and each of the slopes.
3. Compare your intercepts and coefficients to what you had before in the previous parts. Is there anything surprising?
3. Use the values of $s$ and $r^2$ to evaluate how well your model predicts your response variable
4. What do you notice about your value for $r^2$ in comparison to what you did in Part 2 when you had a LSRL with the same response variable?
5. Use the residual plot to evaluate how well your model fits linearly.

You're expected to complete these interpretations as clearly and correctly as you have previously. There's nothing different!!!
