Then you calculate relative frequencies per group\nFor example, here I have a two-way table detailing the hair and eye colour of some statistics students\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSo if I want eye colour to be my groups, I would calculate the relative frequencies by column (use the total of the column and divide the whole column by it), so each group/column will add up to 1.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThese numbers will be my bar heights.

To make a histogram, select an appropriate equal intervals that make it so that you don’t have too many bars and that you don’t have too few bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYour goal with histograms, as with many other visualizations, is to be able to see the shape and characteristics of the distribution in question. If you have too many bars or too few bars, you won’t be able to see much important information (especially think of situations when you have many data points with very precise decimal measurements).\n\n\n\nDecide on your intervals (e.g. by 5’s, by 10’s, by 100’s)\nWithin your intervals, count up the number of observations that belong in that “bin”. When you do so, count up observations so that you count the left end inclusive and the right end inclusive. So if you did intervals of 5, you would do something like counting up points \\(0 \\leq x &lt; 5\\), \\(5 \\leq x &lt; 10\\), and so on.\nPlot your bars.\n\nExample:\nConsider this example data set:\nOur data has this set of summary statistics:\n\n\n       x        \n Min.   :1.522  \n 1st Qu.:1.912  \n Median :2.022  \n Mean   :2.110  \n 3rd Qu.:2.224  \n Max.   :2.704  \n\n\nWith this knowledge, let’s make our 7 “bins”, so let’s do these by every 0.2, starting at 1.5 to 2.9. This will be something that you build by intuition.\nNow, count up our values:\n\n\n[1.5,1.7) [1.7,1.9) [1.9,2.1) [2.1,2.3) [2.3,2.5) [2.5,2.7) [2.7,2.9] \n        1         4         6         5         1         2         1 \n\n\nNow, we just put it together. For each bin, we have a bar and the bars’ heights correspond to the number of individuals in each bin.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, just like bar graphs, we can instead do the relative frequencies (this is what you’ll see most of the time!!!)\n\n\n[1.5,1.7) [1.7,1.9) [1.9,2.1) [2.1,2.3) [2.3,2.5) [2.5,2.7) [2.7,2.9] \n     0.05      0.20      0.30      0.25      0.05      0.10      0.05 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen you have a histogram like this, keep in mind that the bars always add up to 1 (or 100%)."
