When choosing which one to use to describe a set of data, you have to consider whether there is skewness or outliers in your distribution then choose appropriately between the mean and the median.\n\n3.3.1 Mean / Average\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean / Average\n\n\n\nThe average of a set of quantitative data, also known as the mean, can be found by adding up all the values in the set and dividing by the total amount of data points.\nWhen we do this for a population, we are able to calulate the population mean, \\(\\mu_X\\).\n\\[\\mu_X x = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum x_i = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n}\\]\nWhen we do this for a sample, we are able to calulate the sample mean, \\(\\bar x\\).\n\\[\\bar x = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum x_i = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n}\\]\n\n\nThe mean is not a robust measurement. In other words, it is non-resistant to outliers of skewness in data. This makes it so that the mean is not a reliable measure of center when there is skew or outliers.\n\n\n3.3.2 Median\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian\n\n\n\nThe median of a set of quantatitative data can be found by finding the “middle value” in the set of data.\nIf trying to find the median, make sure to : 1. sort the data from lowest to highest and then 2. point out the middle value and a. if there is an odd number of values, you can point out a value from the data set itself. b. if there is an even number of values, you have to find the average of the middle two values from the data set and use that average as the median.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you know how long the data set is, you can count up the to the\n\nIf it’s odd number of values: the \\(\\frac{n}{2} + 0.5\\) th value\nIf it’s an even number of values: the \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\) th and the \\(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\) th values\n\n\n\nThe mean is not a robust measurement. In other words, it is resistant to outliers of skewness in data. This makes it so that the median is reliable measure of center when there is skew or outliers. Think of how housing prices work–everytime housing prices are talked about, the median housing price is mentioned. Why? Because using the mean would misrepresent what the typical housing price is. The more expensive houses in the area will pull the mean into the the further region of housing prices.",

    "text": "3.4 Measures of Spread / Variation\nThe spread (or variation, used interchangably) of a ditribution of data describes how spread out the set of data is.\nYou essentially have 2 choices to use: 1. The range and standard deviation or 2. The IQR\nThe choice again revolves around the characteristics of the distribution–whether there is skewness or outliers.\n\n3.4.1 Range\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange\n\n\n\nRange is a single number that describes the distance from the maximum value to the minimum value. Calculate the range by subtracting the maximum value by the minimum value.\n\\[\\text{range} = \\text{max} - \\text{min}\\]\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you know how to use range in a sentence properly\n\nRange is a statistical measure. If a maximum of a data set is 10 and the minimum of a data set of 3. You can say “The range is 7.”\nYou cannot say “The range is 3 to 10”. This means that you do not understand that range is a single number calculated with the formula above.\nHowever, you can opt into a more English orientated sentence by saying “The data ranges from 3 to 10.””\n\nThe range is a non-resistant measure. It does not particluarly describe data properly when there is skewness or outliers. This is because the minimum and maximum both change erratically in the presence of skewness or outliers.\n\n\n3.4.2 Interquartile Range (IQR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterquartile Range\n\n\n\nThe IQR is a single number that describes the distance from the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile. Calculate the IQR by subtracting the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile.\n\\[\\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1\\]\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the 1st quartile (\\(Q_1\\)) and the 3rd quartile (\\(Q_3\\))?\n\nIf the median describes the value in the middle of the data set, then the 1st quartile describes the value at 1/4 of the data set and the 3rd quartile describes the value at the 3/4 of the data set.\nFind the quartiles manually by:\n\nFollowing the steps for finding the median.\nAfter identifying the median, separate the data set into two halves.\n\nIf you had a odd number of values, then exclude the one number that you pointed out the be the median in the halves.\nIf you had an even number of values, then don’t exclude any numbers.\n\nFollow the steps to find the median in both halves! You’ll have identified the 1st quartile in by looking at the half with smaller numbers and the 3rd quartile by looking at the half with larger numbers.\n\n\nThe IQR is a resistant measure. It describes data properly when there is skewness or outliers. This is because the 1st quartile and 3rd quartile are similar to the median in resistance.\n\n\n3.4.3 Standard Deviation (SD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Deviation (SD)\n\n\n\nThe standard deviation of a set of data is a number that roughly describes the average distance of every data point to the mean of the data set.\nWhen we do this for a population, we are able to calulate the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma_X\\).\n\\[\\sigma_X = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum (x_i - \\bar x)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x_i -\\bar x)^2}{n}}\\]\nWhen we do this for a sample, we are able to calulate the sample standard deviaiton, \\(s_x\\).\n\\[s_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum (x_i - \\bar x)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x_i -\\bar x)^2}{n - 1}}\\]\nNotice that there is a slight difference in calculation between the two formulas. It’s not possible to explain this difference between the formulas without a better understanding of calculus and probability. But just know that you’ll never use the formula for population standard deviation, and that if you are asked to calculate sample standard deviation, that the second formula above is the only one that you’ll ever use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Standard Deviation\n\n\n\nThe [variable in the context of the problem] typically varies by [value of SD] from the mean of [value of the mean]\n\n\nThe range is a non-resistant measure. It does not particluarly describe data properly when there is skewness or outliers. This is because the standard deviation essentially follows the formula for mean. And as we know, the mean is a non-resistant measure because it changes erratically in the presence of skewness or outliers.",

Then we plot any outliers as individual points.\n\n\nLook at this example data:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFive number summary:\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median 3rd Qu.

    "text": "5.4 Histograms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms\n\n\n\nA histogram is similar to a bar plot, except that histograms are made for quantitative data and bars are continuous in the sense that there is no gap between bars. To make a histogram, select an appropriate equal intervals that make it so that you don’t have too many bars and that you don’t have too few bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYour goal with histograms, as with many other visualizations, is to be able to see the shape and characteristics of the distribution in question. If you have too many bars or too few bars, you won’t be able to see much important information (especially think of situations when you have many data points with very precise decimal measurements).\n\n\n\nDecide on your intervals (e.g. by 5’s, by 10’s, by 100’s)\nWithin your intervals, count up the number of observations that belong in that “bin”. When you do so, count up observations so that you count the left end inclusive and the right end inclusive. So if you did intervals of 5, you would do something like counting up points \\(0 \\leq x &lt; 5\\), \\(5 \\leq x &lt; 10\\), and so on.\nPlot your bars.\n\nExample:\nConsider this example data set:\nOur data has this set of summary statistics:\n\n\n       x        \n Min.   :1.522  \n 1st Qu.:1.912  \n Median :2.022  \n Mean   :2.110  \n 3rd Qu.:2.224  \n Max.   :2.704  \n\n\nWith this knowledge, let’s make our 7 “bins”, so let’s do these by every 0.2, starting at 1.5 to 2.9. This will be something that you build by intuition.\nNow, count up our values:\n\n\n[1.5,1.7) [1.7,1.9) [1.9,2.1) [2.1,2.3) [2.3,2.5) [2.5,2.7) [2.7,2.9] \n        1         4         6         5         1         2         1 \n\n\nNow, we just put it together. For each bin, we have a bar and the bars’ heights correspond to the number of individuals in each bin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, just like bar graphs, we can instead do the relative frequencies (this is what you’ll see most of the time!!!)\n\n\n[1.5,1.7) [1.7,1.9) [1.9,2.1) [2.1,2.3) [2.3,2.5) [2.5,2.7) [2.7,2.9] \n     0.05      0.20      0.30      0.25      0.05      0.10      0.05 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen you have a histogram like this, keep in mind that the bars always add up to 1 (or 100%).",
